# Blog
Description:
The Simple Blog Layout is a responsive, single-page web design built using HTML5, Bootstrap 5, and custom CSS. It features a fixed-top navigation bar with smooth scroll behavior for seamless transitions between Home, Blog, About, and Contact sections. The blog section showcases responsive Bootstrap cards, each with an image, title, brief description, and a call-to-action button. A clean grid system ensures the layout adapts perfectly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The footer includes social media icons, enhancing connectivity and user engagement. Custom CSS enhances the visual appeal with hover effects, section spacing, and typography. This project serves as an ideal front-end template for personal blogs or portfolio showcases.
